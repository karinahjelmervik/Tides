Accurate tidal forcing is important in fjord models...

We have proposed a new and simple method to adjust tidal forcing. The method is straight forward. First we run the ocean model with global tidal forcing, for example the global TPXO with a resolution of 1/4 degree. Secondly, we run harmonic analysis in order to compare the simulated and observed water level for each tidal component. The ratio between observed and simulated amplitude and a phase difference are computed for each tidal component. The ratio and the phase difference are used to adjust the tidal forcing. The same ratio and phase difference is applied on the amplitudes of both water level and current. The model is rerun with adjusted tidal forcing and the results checked.

The method is tested on two different areas, the Oslofjord and the Saltfjord, both in Norway.
 
The results are promising
