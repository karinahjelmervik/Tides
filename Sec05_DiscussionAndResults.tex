\section{Discussion and results}

Both fjord models are run twice. The first run use the original tidal forcing, as generated directly from the TPXO atlases, and the second run with the adjusted tidal forcing. The results improved for both the Oslofjord, and for the Saltstraum. 

In the first run with the Oslofjord model, the amplitudes did not match and the maximums appeared too late in time (see Figure \ref{fig:Viker_timeseries}). In the second run the both phases and amplitudes improved. Table \ref{tab:Viker} shows that the adjustments had the desired effect close to the open boundary, while Table \ref{tab:Oscarsborg} shows that the simulated tides are distributed as intended in the inner parts of the fjord. 

For the Salstraum, time series reveal that the amplitudes are too small and the maximums appeared too early (see Figure \ref{fig:Saltstraumen_timeseries}). Table \ref{tab:Bodo} shows that the amplitudes are still too small in the second run, but closer to the observed values than the first run. The error in phase for M$_2$ was only $0.8$ degrees which corresponds to three minutes (Table\-\ref{tab:Bodo}).

The barotropic tide propagates with a phase speed of $c = \omega/k \approx \sqrt{g h_c}$ where $g$ is the acceleration of gravity and $h_c$ is the characteristic depth. The distance from Viker to Oscarsborg is approximately 75 km and the mean depth is around 200 meters which gives an approximate phase speed of 44 m/s and a phase lag of approximately 28 minutes. According to Table \ref{tab:Viker} and \ref{tab:Oscarsborg} the observed phase lag is 17 degrees for M$_2$ which corresponds to 35 minutes which is only slightly longer than the approximate theoretical phase lag. 

When the tidal wave enters a semi-enclosed basin, choking may occur if the inlet is sufficient narrow as in the western branch in the Oslofjord and inside the Saltraum. Tidal chocking implies a decrease of tidal amplitude and a corresponding phase lag \cite[]{stigebrandt80}. This well-known phenomena is observed in several landlocked fjords or basins, for example Nord{\aa}svatnet in Norway \cite[]{glenne63}, Mundau-Manguaba in Brazil \cite[]{oliveira93}, and Negembo Lagoon in Sri Lanka \cite[]{rydberg96}. 

Fields of the amplitude and phase for M$_2$ in the Oslofjord reveal some interesting phenomenas (Figure \ref{fig:Oslofjord_tidal_fields}). The M$_2$ amplitude decreases gradually northward from the open boundary in the south. In the western branch tidal choking occur as the water pass through the very narrow passage called the Svelvikstraum, while both the amplitude and the phase increase north of the sill in the eastern branch. The observed phase lag in the western branch is more pronounced in the observations than in the model. The cause is most probably the smoothing of the topography in the model.

The spatial variation is larger in the Saltstraum model as the choking is more pronounced (Figure \ref{fig:Saltstraumen_field}). Outside the Saltstraum, the narrow straight separating the two fjords, the M$_2$ amplitude is quite uniform at approximately $80$ cm, while on the inside it is only about $35$ cm. The corresponding phase delay is approximately $60$ degrees. Unfortunately, there is no available tidal gauges inside of the Saltstraum.
%, so we have no means of validating whether or not these values are correct. But we can speculate that we would se similar inconsistencies as those in the Oslofjord, due to smoothing of the model topography.

In coastal areas the currents vary both in time and over relatively short distances both vertically and horizontally. The currents at a position near Filtvedt in the Oslofjord were measured using a bottom-mounted profiling current meter from 18 September to 25 November 2014. The depth at the observation location was 167 meters. Time series of the observations reveal that the currents vary strongly with depth (Figure~\ref{fig:Filtvedt_timeseries}). The tides are evident except during storm surges where other effects dominate. In the lower levels more water run northwards during low and rising tide than southwards during high and descending tide. The tides in the upper levels are delayed in time compared to the lower levels. The velocities in the upper levels are difficult to determine due to noise. 

In order to compare observed and modelled tidal currents, harmonic analyses are performed on the depth integrated currents. The  probability density functions reveal that the flow pattern has changed remarkable from run 1 to run 2 (Figure\-\ref{fig:Filtvedt_pdf}). In the observations more water flow north than south below 40 meters depth. The currents below 40 meters depth are more evenly distributed in the model. The currents in the upper layers are more sensitive to changes in the tidal forcing. 

An accurate representation of the currents at one specific position in shallow areas cannot be expected. 


%The Saltstraumen is one of the worlds strongest tidal currents. Due to a narrow passage the tidal amplitude is much smaller inside the narrow passage than outside the passage, resulting in strong currents. 
%The presence of Saltstraumen as a major impact on the circulation in the Saltfjord. According to \cite{svendsen96} an anticyclonic vortex is formed to the northeast of Saltstraumen, and a cyclonic vortex to the northwest.
%%% Fra Svendsen et. al 1996
%%%They are caused by the high velocity water coming out from Saltstraumen on the falling tide, where the velocity reaches a maximum of about 4 m s1: The anti-cyclonic vortex is weaker when the tide is rising, but does not reverse direction. The cyclonic vortex almost vanishes on rising tides. These results are in accordance with the results from Resipientunderskelse (Anon., 1990) where a direct measurement of the velocity field was performed over a time period of 10 days.
