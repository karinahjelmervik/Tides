\section{Introduction}

Tides are said to have the longest and most extensive history as a subject of scientific research among all altimetric corrections \cite[]{egbert94,cartwright77,hendershott81}. Already in 1947, the tides was thought to be so well understood that Unna stated that the expressions must not be applied too literally, for that would imply that the tidal wave behave as it ought to do, which is not the case \cite[]{unna47}. Two decades later, Munk and Cartwright apologised for attempting to improve the one geophysical prediction that worked tolerably well already \cite[]{munk66}. Since then numerous scientists have continued to improve the understanding and prediction of tides. 

The tides are especially challenging in coastal waters. Along the Norwegian coast tides are one of the dominant contributor to sea level variations \cite[]{grabbe09}. Numerous fjords with different topography, climatology, and dynamics are affected by tides. For the local communities and industries it is important to improve knowledge of the tides. 

As in many regional models \cite[]{gjevik89}, the tides are often imposed only on the boundary of the fjord models. Close to the coastline, the tides vary over short distances. The TPXO Atlantic database with a horizontal resolution of 1/30$^o$ \cite[]{egbert94,egbert02} is too coarse to get the correct phase and amplitude. Here we propose a new method on how to adjust the global tidal forcing to local ocean models.
