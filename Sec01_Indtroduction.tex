\section{Introduction}

Along the norwegian coast numerous fjords ... 
There is great variation between the fjords: topographical, climatological, and dynamical.


Tides are one of the dominant contributor to sea level variations along the Norwegian coast \cite[]{grabbe09}. The exception are storm surge events \cite[]{lynge13}.

The tides are one of the major driving forces in the fjords. \textcolor{Red}{Noe generelt om fjordmodeller}

The tides are often imposed only on the boundary of the fjord models. Close to the coastline, the tides vary over short distances. The TPXO Atlantic database with a horizontal resolution of 1/30$^o$ \cite[]{egbert94,egbert02} is too coarse to get the correct phase and amplitude. Here we propose a new method on how to adjust the global tidal forcing to local ocean models.
